## 0.9.0.0 Release Candidate 1

Key Info

 - **VERSIONING CHANGE** 

 - **This update is NOT save game compatible.**
 - **I added a mod that automatically checks for modlist updates once you load a game**
 - **The main menu has been reworked to be personalized to this list, links to my KoFi and Readme can be found and clicked on in the top left corner of the main menu.**
 - **There were tons of changes in this update, very big possibility that I've introduced new bugs, or unfixed old ones. Consider this the preliminary release before the nexus, please report ALL bugs you find.**
 
<Details>
<summary>Patch Notes</summary>

### Bug Fixes
- TONS of consistency issues that were missed on the first pass of CR for beta 1
- TONS of lighting fixes in a bunch of locations - Atmosphere should look much more consistent throughout the world, especially interiors.
- Landscape mismatching issue outside of Helgen
- More black face bugs, hopefully the last of them
- Lots of water records were improperly overwritten, this is now fixed (basically means water should match everywhere now, and lod seam should be less visible)

</Details>
<Details>
<summary>Changes</summary>

### Changed
- More conflict resolution
- Dodging animations, unfortunatly it has the side effect of a sussy first person dodge. I think technically it gives you the i-frame still, but you won't go anywhere. I suggest just not dodging 
in first person.
- Stamina Consumption for dodging now works as intended (before there was no stamina consumption and very over powered due to that.)
- Rebuilt LODs
- Rebuilt grass cache
- LOD quality *significantly* increased, there should be very little pop-in.
